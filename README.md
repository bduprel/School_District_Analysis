# School_District_Analysis

##School District Overview
This exercise was done to investigate if score tampering was occurring at Thoms High School, and if so, what impact it would have on the overall results 

##Results of the Exercise

### District Summary
When comparing the results before and after the Nan change, we can see a decrease in the overall scores for Thomas High School. Since this is a Charter school type, it only has an impact on the Charter table and shows a marginal decrease.

### Score and Budget Summary
The two images show THS before and after the changes were made. As seen, there is a small decrease in in the math and reading average scores. But when looking at the percent of passing scores, we see a decrease in math, but an increase in reading and overall percent of students passing. However, both changes seem to be insignificant
In fact, when looking at all categories, there seems to be little, or even no change. When looking at budget and average cost per student, there was no change. 

##Summary of Results 
It seems that changing the ninth grade scores to NaN had little to no impact on the subjects reviewed or the overall passing percentages
